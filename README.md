The dataset being used is called Average Cost of Undergraduate College by State. Collected by the National Center of Education Statistics Annual Digest. Found on Kaggle - @kenmoretoast, updated a month ago. The dataset focuses on average undergraduate tuition and fees and room and board rates charged for full-time students in degree-granting postsecondary institutions, by control and level of institution and state or jurisdiction from the years 2013-2021.

The general info tab goes more in-depth about the dataset and details who it is intended for and I chose to analyze this dataset. It also
includes a random sample of rows from the data.

The plot tab shows a scatterplot of the tuition for each state. The user can select the states individually via checkbox, and can also
show multiple states at a time on the scatterplot. There also are radio buttons to add a trendline to the scatterplot or not. In the
bottom right corner of the graph, there is a counter that counts the number of datapoints shown on the scatterplot at any time.

The table tab shows the average cost of colleges per state for the entire timeframe (2013-2021). It lists the states in descending
order from most expensive to least expensive. The user can use radio buttons to filter the table by type of college (public for both in and out of state and private). On top of the data table, there is a text that reacts to the widget inputs, telling the user the
5 most expensive states for each type of college.
